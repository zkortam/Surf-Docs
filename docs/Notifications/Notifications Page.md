# Notifications Page

The Notifications page allows you to visualize all of your notifications. At the top, it has a display showing you the different categories that make up your notifications. Below it, there's a section that displays all of your recent notifications with buttons to navigate to where they originated, in addition to a Mark All as Read button.
