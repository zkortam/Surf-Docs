# Creating a Thread

In order to create your Thread, go to the **Create Post** page by pressing the Plus(+) button, either at the bottom of your screen(Mobile) or the side(PC). You will see two tabs. One for Posts and one for Threads. Simply swipe left or click Threads at the top to open the Threads creation tab. 

Within the Threatds tab, click the title field to enter your title and the text field below to enter your thoughts. You also have two interactive buttons beneath the text field. One is for creating polls, while the other button that looks like a star is for **Text Beautification**, which utilizes AI to fix up your text gramatically. 

Once everything is ready, click the Post button to post your thread.
