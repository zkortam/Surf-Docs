# Thread Components

When you long-press a thread, the **Thread-Control Widget** pops up. Within it, you can do the following interactions:
1. Share the thread. If you're on mobile, this will open your sharing menu.
2. Copy the link to the thread.
3. If it's your thread, you'll be able to edit the text.
