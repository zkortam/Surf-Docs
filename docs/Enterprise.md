# Surf Enterprise

**Surf Enterprise** is one of the products that Surf offers, but explicitly to businesses. It allows for businesses to hold a presence on Surf, along with numerous other perks.

Without Surf Enterprise, your business is not permitted to make any posts/threads regarding your products. Doing so will be a violation of our Terms of Use and can warrant removal. Surf Enterprise will allow your business to create such posts/threads, however, Surf does not display advertisements, so your content will be like every other content.

In addition to posting access, you will also have an exclusive and customizable business page, roles within the page, analyitics, and a custom enterprise badge.
