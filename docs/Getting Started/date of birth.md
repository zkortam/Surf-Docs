# Date of Birth Policy

You must be 13 and above to use Surf. Otherwise, you are in violation of our Terms of Service. On the **Date of Birth** page, you declare your date of birth by using the Date of Birth Field.

The Date of Birth Field ensures that all users are compliant to the Surf Terms of Service. 
The Date of Birth Field is arranged in MM/DD/YY Format. Once birth of date is entered in the field, it will verify your age. If you are 13+, then you will be asked to continue with filling the other fields.
