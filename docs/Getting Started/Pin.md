# Pin Creation

For user's privacy and safety across multiple devices, Surf users are required to submit a 4 digit PIN.
This PIN is used everytime the user accesses their settings and sensitive parts of the application. Please make sure that you remember and save your pin. 

Following the entry of your pin, you will be asked as to whether or not you'd like to enable biometric authentication instead of your pin. This means that you'd be able to use fingerprint, facial, or iris scanning instead of your pin.
