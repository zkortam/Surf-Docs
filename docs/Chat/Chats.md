# Chats

When you're in a chat, you will see the messages of the other user on the left, while your own will be on the right. They will also have the time at which you posted them.

At the very top, there is a bar that contains their profile picture and username along with the last time the chat was used. 

At the bottom, there is a field for entering your message, an option to upload an image, in addition to a send button. When you upload an image, it automatically sends it.
