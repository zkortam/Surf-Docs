# Creating a post

In order to create your post, go to the **Create Post** page by pressing the Plus(+) button, either at the bottom of your screen(Mobile) or the side(PC).

Within the Create post Page, click the upload button to choose the image you'd like to upload and upload it. Once uploaded, it will be visible for you to preview. If you'd like to change the image, simply click the swap button and it will remove the image and allow you to change your selection.

There is also a **Spoiler** button the top right (Looks like a ghost), next to the **Post** button. When clicked, it enables Spoiler mode. With Spoiler mode, your post still uploads and shows up as normal, but it requires that a user click your post for them to be able to see it. 

Once you've selected your image, enter your caption and click **Post**.
