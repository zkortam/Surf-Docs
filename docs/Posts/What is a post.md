# What is a Post?

A **Post** is a form of user-generated media within Surf. It allows you to express yourself by sharing an image as well as a caption. 

Surf Posts are divided up into two key sections:

1. The image itself
2. The **Post Bar**, which contains the poster's information, the caption, as well as **interactive buttons** like the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons. Additionally, it also contains an indicative number for the **post score**, which tells you the net opinion on your post based on user reactions.

When you single press a post or double tap the post bar, it will take you to the comments section. Additionally, if you long-press the post, it will open the **Post-Control Widget** which will allow you to manage your post.
