# Comments

Users can comment on posts in order to provide their reactions or express their thoughts. In order to leave a comment, you can either click on the post to open the comments section, or, if you're on the **Home Page** on PC, you can click the Comments expansion button at the top right, which will not only allow you to see all the comments on every post, but also enable you to post a comment.
